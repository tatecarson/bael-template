Though the model is pre-trained with the author’s local environmental sounds, the user can train the model further on their unique soundscape so that each user gets a personalized experience. After the training process, the user can listen to ambient music based on traits of the surrounding anthrophony. If the app senses less anthrophony and more biophony or geophony, then the music fades away, bringing the user’s attention to the anthrophony.\n\n[App](https://soundsaware.com/) | [Paper]() | [Code] (https://github.com/tatecarson/walking-machine-listening)",
