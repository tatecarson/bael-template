A contact mic is used to pickup the intricate, machine-like sounds coming from the box, in addition to the itâ€™s melody. My interest is the intersection between these noise and harmonic sounds. The melody is treated plainly at the beginning and ending of the piece. Granular synthesis is used to decontextualize the melodic sounds into drones and shorter re-pitched sounds. \n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"20\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" title=\"Lamella\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/265024743&amp;color=95bcda&amp;inverse=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_user=false\"></iframe>",
