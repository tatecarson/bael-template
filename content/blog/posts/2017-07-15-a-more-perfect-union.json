The longer a person listens to a melody the more likely an aspect of that melody persist in future generations. The work is based on an evolutionary algorithm, in which the fittest sound of a group passes on its genes, combines with another fit sound, and creates a new one with the best of both. The piece ends when an emergent sound is found that should hopefully satisfy the audience.\n\nFor more details about the work see the [paper](http://tatecarson.com/assets/papers/wac-2018-perfect.pdf) I presented at Web Audio Conference 2018.\n\n<iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/267062963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
